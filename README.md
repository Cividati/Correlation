# Time series forecasting tool
This is a scientific iniciation from [National Telecommunications Institute](inatel.br) titled "Development a Financial Time Series Forecasting Tool in a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game".

## Abstract
This project aims to correlate two currencies values, the country currency (BRL, USD, EUR, TWD and CNY) and the World of Warcraft realm currency named wowtoken (Us, Eu, Ch, Kr and Tw), use the linear regression algorithm, and plot a graphic that show the past of curriencies and the future.

## Setting up
First of all, we are using the [Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/).

### Installing the requirements
You can download this repository as a zip, and run the following command in to terminal to install the dependecies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
### Scripts
Description of the scripts. Run in sequence.

#### setdb.py
This script create the whole database that we will use in this project. The database's name is wow.db

#### script.py
This script is able to collect the wowtoken value from wowtokenprices.com and the curriencies value from exchangeratesapi.

#### adjustdb.py
This one is capaple to organize the data that we have colleted before, and generate the maens value and average values from each currency and wowtoken, after this process, the script will create a new database called wow_az.db

#### plot.py
The function of this script is plot the data found in wow_az.db.
